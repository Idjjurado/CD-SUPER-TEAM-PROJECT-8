## Description
This passion project was created so fans of anime, cartoons,
and other tv shows. Can have a place to find some of the amazing 
dishes that can be found. Here at Umai Foods, we have 
options to have a random recipe pulled and to generate a search. 
Based on a type of food be it spicy, sweet, or umami. 

## Usage
To use this food search, the user can type an ingredient within 
the search bar to yield a number of recipes that contain said ingredient.
If the user is craving a particular type of food then there are buttons that 
will populate a recipe tied to that flavor. Along with an anime recommendation
containing a short description. If a user finds a recipe that wish to make they can save
the recipe with the click of a button. Which the user can find using the favorites button
or by looking at the bottom of the main page.
